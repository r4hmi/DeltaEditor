DeltaEditor is a deltarune save file editor, using it you can change variables in the game such as: hp, def, dmg, money and even the members of the party. 
DeltaEditor is made using python only and the source code is available in my github: https://github.com/r4hmi
if you got this file somewhere else you should probably delete and get it from my github so you dont risk your device i guess
(*i dont think anyone will reupload my stuff, but safe is better than sorry)

anyway, this is my discord for communication
